# Project-3-CECS-326-

How it works so far:

A preset Max matrix, Allocation matrix, and resources available will be assigned. Users will be given the opportunity to check the safe sequence and request resources with our test menu.

In main, Banker Algorithm Test Menu will appear asking for an input from 1-3. Option 1 “Check for safe sequence” will demonstrate the safety_check() functionality of the provided matrixes. Option 2 “User-defined resource request" will ask for which process id you would like to modify and what resources will be requested for that process. Given the process and requested resource the program will perform the request_resource() functionality with the 2 given user inputs. Option 3 “Exit” will end the Banker’s Algorithm.

Compile with your python compiler of choice: Navigate to project file and enter python3 main.py or python main.py
